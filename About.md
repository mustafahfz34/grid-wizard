# 🌌 About Grid Wizard

### “Art, code, and sovereignty — all woven together.”

Grid Wizard began as a wild idea:  
What if we could **trade with transparency, not trust**,  
and **grow sovereign wealth** using tools we fully understand?

## 🪄 Origins

In the spring of 2024, the first experimental builds of the bot—known back then as **Pauly Bot**—were hand-crafted in a small workspace filled with tie-dye art, LED lights, and the hum of code compiling on repeat.  

What started as a playful experiment in automating RLUSD/XRP trading soon evolved into a **mission**:  
to create a **transparent, verifiable, and ethical trading engine** for the XRPL.  

We wanted something that could be studied, improved, and trusted—not a black-box algorithm, but a living piece of open technology.

## 🧩 Months of Iteration & Audit

Grid Wizard v2 is the result of **months of continuous testing**, live audits, and endless refinement.

We stress-tested:
- **Strict caps and pending queues** to prevent overshoot  
- **Side throttles** to handle network lag  
- **Dynamic tranche sizing** tuned by real volatility  
- **Auto-cancel and reserve-relief** logic under high load  
- **Safe submission retries** and graceful handling of `txnNotFound`  
- **Metrics and transparency logging**, showing every placement, skip, and cancel  

Each cycle of testing taught us something new about XRPL behavior under real conditions—  
from price feed latency to reserve constraints to ledger edge-cases.

Every feature was tuned in live environments, on real wallets, with the community watching.

## 🔍 Transparent by Design

We built Grid Wizard to be **source-visible**.  
Anyone can audit how orders are placed, canceled, throttled, or skipped.  
There are no hidden calls, no telemetry, and no secret backdoors.

Every action leaves a visible trace in the logs:
[OpenCap] BUY(open)=2 cap=3 | SELL(open)=0 cap=1
[Cycle] mid=2.84166 placed=2 skipped=0 (throttle=0 pending=0) cancelled=0
That transparency matters—because sovereignty without visibility is just another illusion of control.

## 🎨 Where Art Meets Code

Grid Wizard was born from the same creative energy that powers our art and festival culture.  
We see **technology as art**, and **art as technology**—each medium shaping human freedom in different ways.

The project draws inspiration from:
- **Jumbie Art’s** living colors and spectral forms  
- **Pauly the Dye Wizard’s** creative mentorship  
- The ethos of **building tools that empower, not enslave**

Each line of code is a brushstroke in that vision:  
a piece of generative art designed to protect, grow, and move value with integrity.

## 💎 The Mission

Our purpose is simple yet profound:
> **Protect and grow sovereign wealth** through transparent, auditable tools built on XRPL.

Grid Wizard stands as a bridge between **creative expression** and **financial freedom**—  
proving that code, like art, can be both beautiful and liberating.

## 🧠 Continuing the Journey

The Grid Wizard project is still evolving.  
Each release is an iteration in a long arc of creative engineering:
- Hardening under load  
- Expanding to more assets  
- Integrating with visual dashboards and artistic data representation  

We invite artists, engineers, and dreamers alike to join us—  
to contribute, to audit, to remix ideas, and to help shape this new frontier where **art meets algorithm**.
