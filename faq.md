❓ FAQ

### Q: What does the NFT license actually do?
A: It’s a **software key**. If your wallet holds the NFT, the bot runs in Pro mode.  
It doesn’t give you rights to resell or modify the code — just to use it.

### Q: Is Grid Wizard open source?
A: The code is **source-available** for transparency, but governed by BUSL-1.1.
You can read and audit it, but not redistribute or repackage it.

### Q: Do I need to trust the bot with my funds?
A: No. The bot trades **non-custodially** on XRPL using your own wallet and trustline.

### Q: Can I use this without an NFT?
A: Yes, in free mode — but Pro features (auto-cancel, reserve-relief, dynamic tranche) are disabled.

### Q: How do I verify my NFT license?
A: Run the bot and look for:
[NFT] License verified: issuer=rfYZ17wwhA4Be23fw8zthVmQQnrcdDRi52

### Q: Will there be more NFT tiers?
A: Yes. Future releases may include “Wizard Apprentice” and “Guild Master” tiers for multi-wallet or AI modules.

### Q: Is there a support community?
A: Yes — join the **Bass Mint Discord** and look for the `#grid-wizard` channel.
