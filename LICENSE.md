## How to Obtain a License

### Option 1 â€“ NFT License (on-chain verification)
Purchase or hold a **Grid Wizard Pro XRP NFT License** minted on the XRP Ledger.  
This NFT acts as your perpetual, verifiable proof of use rights.

**Verification Process (built-in):**
- On startup, the Grid Wizard software checks the connected XRPL wallet
  for an NFT issued by Grid Wizard Labs.  
- The NFT metadata must contain `license_type: "Pro"` or equivalent traits.  
- When verified, the software unlocks the **Pro features** such as:
  - Full grid-placement and cancellation automation  
  - Dynamic/Adaptive tranche sizing  
  - Reserve-relief and metrics modules  
  - Hot-reload tuning and UI control access  

Users can review this check directly in the public source
(`wizard_rlusd_grid_v2.py`, section `check_nft_license`), confirming that
no hidden logic or remote calls exist.
