# grid-wizard
A pragmatic, source-available RLUSD⇄XRP grid engine with a lightweight UI, hot-reloadable `.env`, strict caps + pending queues, optional distance auto-cancel, and a tiny AI “breathing layer” (Dynamic Grid Optimizer + **DipsCount** dip-buyback). Built for reliability under XRPL node lag.
